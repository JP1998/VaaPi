# A little website project hosted on a Raspberry Pi

The name VaaPi is derived from the Java backend framework Vaadin (Vaa)
and the well known small single-board computer Raspberry Pi (Pi).

This is a project that lets a Raspberry Pi run a website created with
Vaadin by some nerds trying to have some fun :3

We'll see where the project and our interests lead us and will update
this Readme accordingly.
